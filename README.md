  ## Installation
  Make sure you have node.js installed on your computer/laptop. Then clone the Github repository onto your device. Then make sure that you install inquirer and the file system since you need both of those to run. After that you have everything installed in order to use the generator.

  ## Usage
  Go to where you need the README to be and follow the installation instructions. Then type node readme.js and you will be prompted to answer questions in the terminal. Once you have answered the questions a README file will be available based off of your answers.
